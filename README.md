# The Family Dictionary

## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/csharp/exercises/family_dictionary && cd $_
dotnet new console
dotnet restore
```

Oh, the Glory Days of JavaScript, when creating an object that contains another object was as simple as this.

```js
const myFamily = {
    'sister': {
        'name': 'Krista',
        'age': 42
    },
    'mother': {
        'name': 'Cathie',
        'age': 70
    }
}
```

Well, those days are over while you learn C#. Below you will see an example of how you would do that, without defining a custom type with a class.

## Instructions

1. Define a Dictionary that contains information about several members of your family. Use the following example as a template.

    ```cs
    Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>> myFamily = new Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>>();

    myFamily.Add("sister", new Dictionary<string, string>(){ 
        {"name", "Krista"},
        {"age", "42"}
    });
    ```
2. Next, iterate over each item in `myFamily` and produce the following output.
    ```
    Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
    ```
